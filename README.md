# DeepLearningPython35

## Purpose

This is a learning project for developing neural networks from scratch in python.  This is my work as I follow the [neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) book guide.

* This repository is a fork of [MichalDanielDobrzanski/DeepLearningPython35](https://github.com/MichalDanielDobrzanski/DeepLearningPython35) which is itself a python 3.5 port of the book's provided [code repository](https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning).

## Overview

> The testing file `test.py` contains all three networks (network.py, network2.py, network3.py) from the book and it is the starting point to run (i.e. *train and evaluate*) them.

In test.py there are examples of networks configurations with proper comments. I did that to relate with particular chapters from the book.

## Future Ideas:
* Do some cool experiments with visualizing neurons in my network:

  * [manim library](https://github.com/3b1b/manim)
